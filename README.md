# OTPless-assessment


Here is the demo link of my website https://otplesslogin.netlify.app/index.html.

Note: Kindly open the website on a PC  as the website layouts are not yet responsive.

I have integrated the OTP less login with my website.

When the site is opened navigate to the login/ signup page by clicking on the respective buttons. There you can see “Continue with Whatsapp” button.

On clicking the “Continue with Whatsapp” button a QR code appears on screen and which you have to scan using your smartphones in which your watsapp account is present.

After scanning the QR code from Smartphone whatsapp opens up and chat section of OTPless appears and asks to "send a message to continue".

send this message then the verification process of your watsapp number takes place and you are logged into the website.

Then you are redirected to a new page.
